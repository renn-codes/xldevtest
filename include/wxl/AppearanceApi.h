// A modern model does not carry its own finished look. Which of its parts are visible, what is
// painted onto it, and what extra pieces are worn with it all live in database tables, and the model
// file is the same bytes whichever answer those tables give.
//
// This publishes that answer as ONE shape, deliberately not a character-specific one. A player's look
// comes from the customization tables and a creature's from its display entry, but both end as the
// same three lists, and the consumer that turns those lists into draws should not have to care which
// table produced them. That is also what keeps the split honest: everything on this side of the
// boundary knows the tables and nothing about models, everything on the other side knows models and
// nothing about the tables.
