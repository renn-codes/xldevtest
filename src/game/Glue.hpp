/**
 * @brief The model frame the login and character-select screens are built on.
 *
 * The engine has no single "3D is done" point: it defers every 3D render into a per-frame-object
 * callback, and this frame type owns the one the glue screens use. That callback is also where a
 * different scene can be put in a frame's place.
 *
 * The frame type carries script methods -- SetModel is the one the stock glue Lua calls -- and new
 * ones can be added alongside, which is how a screen says what it should show rather than a file
 * beside the binary saying it on the screen's behalf.
