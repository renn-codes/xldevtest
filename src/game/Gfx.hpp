/**
 * @brief Shapes placed in the world by world coordinate, drawn inside the scene.
 *
 * A module queues shapes wherever it computes them and calls Flush once, from the world-to-interface
 * boundary of the frame. Nothing is retained: the queue is emptied by the flush, so a shape is shown
 * for exactly as long as something keeps asking for it, and a module that stops asking leaves nothing
 * behind to clean up.
 *
 * The camera is not a parameter. The shapes are transformed by the same view and projection the scene
 * was drawn with, read from the device at flush time, so a shape lands where its coordinates say it
 * does without the caller knowing anything about the camera.
 *
 * Two things about when to call which, neither of them guessable:
 *
 * The queue belongs to the binary it is compiled into, not to the process. Each extension carries its
 * own, so no module can disturb another's -- and equally, no module can rely on another to empty its
 * own. Whoever queues is who flushes.
 *
 * The ground-following shapes are priced in collision queries, one per vertex, and belong off the draw
 * path for that reason alone. A module that uses them queues on OnUpdate and flushes on
 * OnWorldSceneEnd: the shapes are decided on the client's own tick, and the draw only hands over what
 * is already decided.
