/**
 * @brief The engine's initialisation routine, exposed as a detour target.
 *
 * It runs once, on the main thread, and brings up the background file reader before the texture
 * subsystem. Detouring its entry is how anything gets in ahead of either -- including the core's own
 * extension loading, which needs a point that is outside the loader lock and still early enough to
 * precede both.
