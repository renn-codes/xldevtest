 * @brief Opts a multi-layer ribbon into the single-pass texture combine at draw.

 * A >= 3 layer ribbon cannot be reproduced by drawing one single-texture pass per layer, so those
 * ribbons take the combine instead. The draw-time hook fires for every ribbon regardless of which
 * pipeline produced the model, so only the layer count decides, not model origin.
