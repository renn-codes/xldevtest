 * @brief Scopes the alpha-key cutoff a source-authored batch expects, at draw time.
 *
 * Source content authors coverage alpha against a lower cutoff than the target's default, so an
 * alpha-key batch of a reshaped model needs its own reference pushed for the duration of that batch.
 * It is device state, not a record field, which is why it lives at draw and not at load.
