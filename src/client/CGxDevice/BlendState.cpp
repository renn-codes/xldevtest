// A blend state is a pair of factors -- how much of the incoming pixel, how much of what is already
// there. The device resolves a state index into that pair through two parallel tables, and those
// tables are fixed-size arrays sitting back to back in read-only data: the last state of the first one
// is immediately followed by the first state of the second, so there is nowhere to append.
//
// Source content asks for blend states this device's tables stop short of. Rather than remap those
// requests onto a state that merely looks similar -- which is what discards the difference -- the
// tables are COPIED into storage of our own with room to spare, the missing states are appended, and
// the device is pointed at the copies. From then on the device genuinely has the states, and every
// consumer that resolves an index gets the right factors without knowing anything changed.
//
// Repointing is two writes. Each table has exactly one reader, and it reads with a single instruction
// carrying the table address as an absolute displacement, so rewriting those displacements moves the
// tables without moving or rewriting a single instruction's behaviour.
