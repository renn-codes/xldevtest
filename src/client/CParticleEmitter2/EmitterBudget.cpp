// Two separate rules budget an emitter, and both start from the same quantity: how many particles it
// expects to have alive at once, its emission rate times its particle lifetime. Both were written for
// DENSE emitters, where rounding a size or throttling a rate only thins a crowd. Source content also
// authors single-billboard effects -- one particle at a time, the whole look carried by that
// particle's flipbook and its fade -- and for those, the same two rules empty the effect outright:
//
//   Pool size     gets a 15% margin so a particle's replacement can be allocated while the particle it
//                 replaces is still fading, then is rounded to NEAREST -- which rounds the margin away
//                 for any expected count under about 1.3 and lands on a single slot. With one slot the
//                 replacement cannot be allocated until the live particle is released, so the emission
//                 period stops following the rate and becomes the LIFETIME instead, leaving a frame
//                 with nothing alive every cycle.
//   Rate falloff  scales emission down to a quarter as the camera pulls away, unless an opt-out flag
//                 is set. That flag is a PLACEMENT property -- nothing a model contains can ask for
//                 it. A quarter of a crowd is still a crowd; a quarter of one particle is a gap.
//
// Both are corrected in the sizing pass, which runs once per frame per enabled emitter, before the
// emission pass, and is shared by every emitter kind. Neither correction ever tightens a limit: the
// sizing call refuses to shrink a pool, and the opt-out only ever removes a throttle. What they cost
// is bounded by what they protect -- an emitter this touches is one holding a handful of particles.
