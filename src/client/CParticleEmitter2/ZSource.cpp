// An emitter's z source is a point the particle is pushed away from, and "there is no such point" is
// spelled two different ways: source content writes a far-away sentinel, the target pipeline expects
// zero. Read literally, the sentinel turns a rising emission cone into a sideways spray, because the
// point-source branch replaces the cone with a direction away from that point.
//
// This is a per-emitter runtime value, not a record field: the same emitter is re-armed every time it
// is rebuilt, so translating the sentinel where the value is consumed covers both the build and the
// per-frame path, and leaves the model bytes exactly as the file has them.
